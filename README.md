# TODO List
- [] Interface must be able to receive and transmit streaming audio data via I2C 
- [] Your design should receive
the audio data, do something to/with it and transmit it back to the codec
- [] Audio processing should
be switchable on/off or you should be able to change filter parameters etc. (for example with buttons/switches)
